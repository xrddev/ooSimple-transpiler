# ooSimple-Transpiler

The **ooSimple-Transpiler** is an educational project that takes a custom object-oriented programming language
(`ooSimple`) and transpiles it into equivalent C code.  
It is implemented using the ANTLR4 framework and demonstrates the key stages of language processing:
parsing, semantic analysis with symbol tables, and structured code generation.

Unlike a traditional compiler that outputs machine code, this project focuses on **source-to-source translation**.
The transpiler allows developers to write in an object-oriented style and obtain readable, valid C programs,
bridging high-level abstractions with a lower-level language.

Key highlights of this project include:

- **Custom Object-Oriented Language:** The `ooSimple` language supports classes, methods, inheritance, variables, and control flow constructs.
- **ANTLR4 Integration:** Grammar-driven parsing using ANTLR4.
- **Semantic Validation:** Symbol table construction and type checking to ensure correctness.
- **Readable C Code Output:** Generates understandable C code, making the project ideal for learning both compiler principles and language translation.

## ANTLR4 Overview

ANTLR4 (Another Tool for Language Recognition) is a parser generator used to build compilers, interpreters, and translators for custom languages. In this project, it is used to define and process the `ooSimple` language. Key aspects include:

### Stages of ANTLR4 Processing

1. **Grammar Definition**: The user defines the grammar of the target language in a `.g4` file. This grammar specifies the rules for tokenizing and parsing the input.
    - Example: `ooSimpleGrammar.g4` describes the structure of the `ooSimple` language.
    - Grammar rules are categorized into lexer rules (for tokens) and parser rules (for syntax structure).

2. **Lexer Generation**: ANTLR4 generates a lexer from the grammar file. The lexer scans the input code and breaks it into tokens based on the rules defined in the grammar.
    - Tokens are the smallest meaningful units like keywords (`class`), identifiers (`myVar`), or symbols (`{`, `}`).
    - The lexer uses regular expressions defined in the grammar to recognize these tokens.

3. **Parser Generation**: ANTLR4 generates a parser that organizes the tokens into a structured hierarchy according to the grammar rules.
    - The parser checks the syntax of the token stream, ensuring it follows the defined grammar.
    - Errors in syntax are reported during this stage.
    - The output of this step is the **parse tree**, which represents the logical structure of the input.

4. **Parse Tree Construction**: The parse tree is a hierarchical representation of the input, where each node corresponds to a rule or token.
    - **Root Node**: Represents the starting rule defined in the grammar.
    - **Child Nodes**: Represent the components or subrules of the parent node.
    - **Leaf Nodes**: Represent individual tokens (e.g., keywords or literals).

5. **Listener or Visitor Execution**: Custom logic can be implemented by traversing the parse tree using Listeners or Visitors to perform tasks like semantic analysis or code generation.
    - Visitors provide a more manual approach, offering greater control over tree traversal.

### Parse Tree and Its Creation

The parse tree is central to how ANTLR4 processes input. Here's how it works:

- **Creation**: ANTLR4 builds the parse tree as the parser processes the input code. Each node in the tree corresponds to a specific grammar rule or token.
- **Structure**: The root node represents the starting grammar rule, and child nodes represent the components of that rule. Leaf nodes are individual tokens.
- **Traversal**: The parse tree can be traversed automatically using Listeners or manually using Visitors.
- **Purpose**: The parse tree serves as a blueprint for further processing, like validating semantics or generating code.

### What Are Listeners?

Listeners are a mechanism provided by ANTLR4 to traverse the parse tree. They automatically respond to events triggered during tree traversal, such as entering or exiting a node.

- **Built-In Methods**:
    - `enterRule`: Called when the parser enters a specific grammar rule.
    - `exitRule`: Called when the parser exits that rule.
- **Custom Implementation**:
    - Users extend the base listener class to add logic for handling specific nodes in the tree.
    - Example: In this project, the `SymbolicTablePhase` listener constructs and validates the symbol table.

### Relationship Between Listeners and the Parse Tree

Listeners interact directly with the parse tree to process the input. Here's how:

1. **Invocation**: As the parse tree is traversed, ANTLR4 automatically invokes the appropriate listener methods (e.g., `enterRule` and `exitRule`) for each node.
2. **Custom Logic Execution**: Listeners implement custom actions for each relevant node, such as:
    - Building a symbol table (e.g., `SymbolicTablePhase` in this project).
    - Generating target code (e.g., `CodeGenerator`).
3. **Event-Driven Processing**: The listener pattern allows event-driven processing, enabling modular and efficient handling of grammar rules.
4. **Efficiency**: Listeners reduce the complexity of manual tree traversal by focusing on specific nodes, allowing modular and organized logic.
5. **Integration**: Each listener method corresponds to a specific rule in the grammar, ensuring a tight connection between the grammar's design and the tree's processing.

By combining the parse tree's hierarchical structure with listeners' event-driven approach, ANTLR4 provides a powerful and flexible framework for language processing.

## Language Design

The `ooSimple` programming language is a custom object-oriented language designed with the following key features:

### Class Definitions

- Classes are declared using the keyword `class`, followed by the class name.
- **Multiple Inheritance**: Supported using the keyword `inherits`. A class may inherit from one or more parent classes, allowing complex hierarchies.
- Example:
  ```python
  class MyClass inherits ParentClass1, ParentClass2:
      ...
  ```

### Method Definitions

- Methods are defined using the keyword `def`, followed by the method name and parameters.
- Methods can return values or modify the object's state.
- The `self` keyword is used as the first parameter to refer to the current instance.
- The return type is specified after a colon `:`. If the method does not return a value, a dash (`-`) is used to indicate `void`.
- Example:
  ```python
  def calculate(self, value): int
      return value * 2;
  ```

### Constructor Definitions

- Constructors are special methods named `__init__` and are used to initialize object properties.
- Example:
  ```python
  def __init__ClassName(self, name): int
      self.name = name;
      ;
  ```

### Main Class

- A special `main` class can be defined to contain the entry point of the program.
- Example:
  ```python
  class Main:
      def main(self):
          print "Hello, World!";
          ;
  ```

### Variables and Declarations

- Variables are declared with their types, such as `int` or `class` types.
- Multiple variables can be declared in a single line.
- Example:
  ```python
  int a, b, c;
  int x;
  int z;
  ;
  ```

### Control Flow Statements

- Standard control flow constructs are supported, such as `if-else`, `while`, and `return`.
- Example of `if-else`:
  ```python
  if (x > 0):
      print "Positive";
  else:
      print "Non-positive";
  endif;
  ```
- Example of `while`:
  ```python
  while (x > 0):
      x = x - 1;
      print x;
  endwhile;
  ```
The ooSimpleGrammar.g4 file describe fully the language structure.

## Compiler Process Flow

The **ooSimple-Transpiler** compiler processes the input `ooSimple` code in a systematic and multi-step approach to produce equivalent C code. The process includes the following stages:

1. **Parse Tree Generation**:
    - The compiler begins by parsing the `ooSimple` input code using the ANTLR4 framework.
    - A hierarchical parse tree is created based on the grammar rules defined in `ooSimpleGrammar.g4`.
    - This tree represents the syntactic structure of the input program, with nodes corresponding to grammar rules or tokens.

2. **First Tree Traversal: Symbol Table Creation**:
    - During the first traversal of the parse tree, a symbol table is constructed.
    - This table stores metadata for program entities, including:
        - **Classes**: Their names, inheritance relationships, and members.
        - **Methods**: Their names, parameter types, return types, and visibility.
        - **Variables**: Their names, types, and scopes.
    - Scoping rules are enforced to manage nested blocks and inheritance.
    - Semantic checks, such as duplicate declarations or undefined parent classes, are performed.

3. **Second Tree Traversal: Code Generation**:
    - The parse tree is traversed a second time to produce equivalent C code.
    - The traversal involves:
        - **Statement Translation**: High-level constructs like `if`, `while`, and `return` are converted to C equivalents.
        - **Variable Resolution**: Ensuring all variables and methods are declared in the symbol table before use.
        - **Output Construction**: Sequentially generating lines of valid C code to replicate the behavior of the input program.
    - Type consistency and scoping rules are revalidated to ensure correctness.

4. **Error Handling**:
    - Syntax errors are reported during the parsing stage.
    - Semantic errors, such as undeclared variables or type mismatches, are reported during the first and second traversals.

This flow ensures a clear separation of concerns, making the compiler modular, extensible, and easy to debug.

## How to Run the Project

The **ooSimple_Compiler** runs directly using the run_antlr.sh script,
which automates the compilation of ooSimple files into C. While IntelliJ IDEA was used during development,
it is not a requirement for running the project.

### Running with the Script

1. **Script Overview**:
    - The project includes a script named `run_antlr.sh` located in the root directory.
    - This script automates the compilation process for the `ooSimple` source code.

2. **Usage Instructions**:
    - Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the project.
    - Run the script using:
      ```bash
      ./run_antlr.sh
      ```
    - Ensure the script has executable permissions. If not, make it executable:
      ```bash
      chmod +x run_antlr.sh
      ```

3. **Input Path**:
    - The script allows you to specify the path of the input `ooSimple` file. Update the input path directly within the script or modify it to accept arguments dynamically.

4. **Output Files**:
    - The generated C files are stored in the `compiler_output` directory within the project.
    - Ensure this directory exists and has write permissions.

5. **Predefined Input Files**:
    - The project includes a directory named `input_code_files` that contains ready-to-use `oos` files for testing.
        - **Subdirectories**:
            - `happy_day_scenario`: Contains valid `oos` files that compile without errors. Examples:
                - `Factor.oos`
                - `MathOperations.oos`
                - `Vehicle.oos`
            - `InvalidSyntaxTests`: Contains `oss` files designed to trigger specific syntax and semantic errors, testing the compiler's robustness in error handling.
                - `undeclaredLocalVariable.oos`
                - `assigmentDataTypesConflict.oos`
                - `methodWrongParameterType.oos`

### Additional Notes

- The script leverages the ANTLR4 runtime and ensures all dependencies are configured correctly.
- It compiles the grammar, processes the input file, and generates C code in one step.
